# Create a job test

The PandaLab gradle plugin makes it easy to create test tasks. It is possible to create several gradle tasks if you have very specific needs.

## Configuration

Add the gradle plugin classpath to the build.gradle file at the root of the project:  

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.pandalab_version = '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.leroymerlin.pandalab:gradle-plugin:$pandalab_version"
    }
}
```

Then modify the build.gradle file of your application module for configure the PandaLab plugin :

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

// add this line to apply the pandalab plugin
apply plugin: 'com.leroymerlin.pandalab'

pandalab {
    serviceAccountFile = file("YOUR FIREBASE ADMIN SDK .JSON")
    appName = "APP NAME"
    apiUrl = "YOUR FIREBASE REST API URL"
}
```

## Create a task

### Method 1 : create a custom gradle task

A PandaLab task allows you to define the various parameters in order to launch your instrumentation tests on a phone fleet. You can define the variant name, the device lists, the device groups on which the tests will be run.

```groovy
import com.leroymerlin.pandalab.tasks.PandaLabTestTask

task runPandaLabTest(type: PandaLabTestTask) {
    variantName = "debug"
    devices = ["345678765433456", "09876543456789098765"]
    groups = ["pandalab"]
    timeoutInSecond = 1800
    waitForResult = false
}
```

* **variantName**: name of the variant to retrieve the apk that will be launched for the tests
* **devices**: the identifiers of the devices on which the tests will be run. The identifiers correspond to the identifiers generated by Firestore.
* **groups**: the name of the groups on which the tests will be run.
* **timeoutInSecond**: timeout in second. The default value is _900 seconds_.
* **waitForResult**: wait for the result on all tests launched. Very useful for fail a CI job. The default value is _true_.


#### Run the task

For launch the previously created task launch the command line : 

```bash
./gradlew app:runPandaLabTest
```

### Method 2 : add test in PandaLab extension

```groovy
pandalab {
    serviceAccountFile = file("...")
    appName = "..."
    apiUrl = "..."
    tests {
        test1 {
            variantName = "debug"
            devices = ["345678765433456", "09876543456789098765"]
            groups = ["pandalab"]
            timeoutInSecond = 1800
            waitForResult = false
        }
        test2 {
            variantName = "debug"
            devices = ["345678765433456", "09876543456789098765"]
            groups = ["pandalab2"]
            timeoutInSecond = 1100
            waitForResult = true
        }
    }
}
```

The different tests declared in `tests` generate a task gradle with the name of the test with the suffix `PandaLabTest`.

In the example above, it generates the tasks : `test1PandaLabTest` and `test2PandaLabTest`


#### Run the task

For launch the previously created tasks launch the command line : 

```bash
./gradlew app:test1PandaLabTest
```
